# wdWar
The Program is composed of two Armies.  Each Army has three divisons, Air, Force and Land.
Each Division has a specific number of Regiments holding ten soldiers per Regiment.
Each Soldier has three attributes, Health, Strength and Speed. Strength and Speed attributes can vary per soldier.

A War can be initiated by clicking the Begin War button, which initiates all battles for all regiments within both armies.
A winner is determined by counting the number of living soldiers after the war.  The Army with the most living soldiers wins.
